# Solid-Wiidget-Library
This is a library of solid widgets, frames, and code for things solid that a typical user may want to use or incorporate into their website and/or solid pod. As a developer I have been reverse engeneering some of the solid code to be able to seperate some of the user icons and widgets in order to use them in a one off code for a specific purpose or application.
# Incorporate solid Code on Your Website:
Feel free to fork this repo and make your own changes and use cases.
